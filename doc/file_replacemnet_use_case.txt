scenario 1
------------
- user opens a show file, with a list of media.
  A list of alternative paths is empty.
- from the first, a number of media are found in declared position.
- then, one item cannot be found in declared position

-- system asks user for an alternative path.
      (Even if user is seraching for a path, files should be visible as well)

case 1: => User selects a path where the target file is present
         - item is added to the show
         - replacement is added to a list of messages that will be shown at the end of loading process
         - the path of the new item is added to a list of alternative paths
         - show is flagged as "changed"

case 2: => User dismisses the request to provide a new path
         - item is missing, so it is not part of the project anymore
         - this is added to a list of messages that will be shown at the end of loading process
         - show is flagged as "changed"

scenario 2
-----------
-* start from scenario 1, case 1
- after the first missing item has been replaced, system parses the next item in show file

case 1: => the item is present in path declared in show file
         - file is loaded; proceed with next file

case 2: => the item is NOT present in path declared in show file, but it is
           present in one of the alternative paths. The search is performed from newest path
           to oldest path
         - item is added to the show
         - replacement is added to a list of messages that will be shown at the end of loading process
           (in this case, no user action is required)

case 3: => the item is NOT present either in path declared in show file and in any of
           the paths of alternative paths list.
         - system asks user for another alternative path.


scenario 3
-----------
-* start from scenario 1, case 3

case 1: => user selects a new path where item is present
         - path is added as first in the queue of alternative paths

case 2: => User dismisses the request to provide a new path
         - item is missing, so it is not part of the project anymore
         - this is added to a list of messages that will be shown at the end of loading process

scenario 4
-----------
-* from any scenario, at the end of show file parse

case 1: => there are messages related to missing media
         - recap messages in a message box that only has OK button.
         - show is loaded with changes

case 2: => there is no message about missing files
         - show is loaded without any message or dialog box
